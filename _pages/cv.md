## Summary

I'm a final-year Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student majoring in Biological Engineering with a specialization in Computational Biology and a minor in Computing from IIT Madras, India. I have developed a robust foundation in machine learning through coursework, research projects, and internships. My professional experiences include contributing to TensorFlow-Google, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Fusic.co Japan, where I worked on TinyML applications, foundational image segmentation models, and real-time computer vision challenges. With creative problem-solving skills, a passion for continuous and collaborative learning, and rich international exposure, I am eager to grow technically and personally to create meaningful contributions to data science.
