During my Google Summer of Code 2022 project with TensorFlow, I developed an exciting 3D Unity game that uses an MPU6050 accelerometer and TinyML for gesture-based controls. This project combines game development, embedded systems, and machine learning in a unique way.

## What You'll Learn

- How to integrate hardware sensors with Unity games
- Implementation of TinyML models on microcontrollers
- Gesture recognition using accelerometer data
- Real-time communication between Arduino and Unity

## Key Features

- **Gesture-Based Controls**: Use hand movements to control game characters
- **TinyML Integration**: On-device machine learning for gesture recognition
- **Real-Time Response**: Low-latency communication for smooth gameplay
- **Complete Tutorial**: Step-by-step guide with code examples

## Technical Stack

- **Unity 3D**: Game engine and development environment
- **Arduino**: Hardware platform for sensor integration
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Machine learning framework for embedded devices
- **MPU6050**: 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope sensor

The project received over 27,000 views on Hackster.io and has become a popular tutorial for anyone interested in combining IoT, AI, and game development.
