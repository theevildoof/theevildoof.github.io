One simple rule: Don't let the ball touch the floor. This is a simple 2D mobile game that generates a grid of obstacles from a set of prefabs every time it starts. To make the game more interesting, I added dynamic color changes to the ball & the background, that are triggered based on collisions with other game objects. The score is a function of the time elapsed since the start of the game.
