One of my most ambitious hardware projects has been developing an open-source smartwatch from scratch. This project aims to create a fully functional smartwatch with open-source firmware, making wearable technology more accessible to the maker community.

## Project Vision

The goal is to create a smartwatch that developers can modify, improve, and customize according to their needs. By open-sourcing the firmware and providing comprehensive documentation, I hope to enable others to build their own wearable devices.

## Current Status

The project has successfully passed the prototyping phase and is now moving towards production-ready hardware design. Here's what's been accomplished:

### âœ… Completed Features

- **Basic Firmware**: Core functionality implemented
- **Display System**: OLED display integration
- **Sensor Integration**: Heart rate, accelerometer, and gyroscope
- **Power Management**: Battery optimization algorithms
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Basic communication protocols

### ðŸ”§ Next Steps

- **PCB Design**: Moving from breadboard to custom PCB
- **ESP-IDF Migration**: Porting codebase to ESP-IDF platform
- **Case Design**: 3D printable enclosure development
- **App Development**: Companion mobile application

## Technical Architecture

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32-based system
- **Display**: OLED screen with touch support
- **Sensors**: MPU6050, MAX30102 heart rate sensor
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth LE for smartphone integration
- **Power**: Lithium polymer battery with wireless charging

## Open Source Philosophy

This project embodies the spirit of open-source hardware development. All code, schematics, and documentation are freely available for the community to use, modify, and improve upon.
