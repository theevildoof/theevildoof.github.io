As part of my Google Summer of Code 2022 project, I created a comprehensive tutorial on building TinyML image recognition systems using the OV7670 camera module. This project demonstrates how to implement computer vision on resource-constrained devices.

## Project Overview

This tutorial guides you through building a complete TinyML image recognition system that can run on microcontrollers with minimal power consumption. Perfect for IoT applications where cloud connectivity isn't available or practical.

## What You'll Build

- **Real-time Image Capture**: Using OV7670 camera module
- **On-device ML Inference**: TensorFlow Lite models running on Arduino
- **Low Power Operation**: Optimized for battery-powered applications
- **Portable System**: Compact design suitable for embedded applications

## Key Components

- **OV7670 Camera Module**: Low-cost VGA camera sensor
- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**: Microcontroller with built-in ML capabilities
- **TensorFlow Lite Micro**: Optimized ML framework for microcontrollers
- **Edge Impulse**: Platform for training and deploying ML models

## Technical Highlights

- Image preprocessing and optimization techniques
- Model quantization for efficient inference
- Memory management strategies for constrained devices
- Real-time performance optimization

This project has been incredibly popular in the maker community, helping thousands of developers get started with TinyML and embedded computer vision.
